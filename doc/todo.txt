To-do list
----------

- General maintenance
  - Add package structure: setup.py, etc.
  - Remove setup.py
  - Add actions workflows
- Docstrings everywhere
- Add __all__ to __init__.py
- Convert namedtuple types to typing.NamedTuple subclasses, or perhaps dataclasses.
- Add names to the standard rounding modes so that their representations are
  pleasanter. (Currently looks like 'standard_rounding_mode.<locals>.round_decide.)
- Formatting:
  - Alignment
  - Support for 'e', 'g', '%', 'n'
  - Support for thousands separators
  - Find a way to resolve ambiguity between the two uses of z (for round-ties-to-zero
    and for negative sign suppression).

Done
----

- Change name of the package to 'rounder'
